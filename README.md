A voxel minecraft-like game I'm making in C++ and OpenGL.
I am also using this GLFW CMake [project setup](https://github.com/meemknight/GLFWCMakeSetup).

## Controls
WASD - Move

Space - Jump

Left Click - Destroy block

Right Click - Place block

Scroll - swap between blocks

## Current Features
- Procedural World Generation
	- Infinite world generation
	- Caves
	- Trees
- Block Placing and Breaking
- Player Movement and Player collision

## Planned Features
- Improved performance when generating chunks
- Improved terrain generation (using splines)
- HUD (showing current picked block and a crosshair)
